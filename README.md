# Rome

![Rome, generated by Grok](rome.jpg)

We propose *Rome*, an ensemble approach grounded in parallelism and diversity, to enhance solution robustness by avoiding the pitfalls of single-solution models. The integration of these methods within a unified framework not only broadens the exploration space but also increases the likelihood of achieving more accurate and optimal solutions for complex mathematical problems.


# Getting Started
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
